# AWS-Data-Exchange-for-APIs

This ipython notebook file contains all the code used for the AWS Data Exchnage for API challenge. 

**How to use**
1.  Ensure the data file named `Desktop_p_views.json` and the notebook file are in the same directory or in your current working directory.
2.  Run all the cells of the notebook. You will be prompted to enter a domain, then hit enter. Example of valid inputs include: bbc.com, facebook.com, twitter.com, google.com, and linkedin.com. 
3.  The report generated will contain both the virus scan results and plots from the time series analyis and forecast. Please note that irrespective of the domain entered, the time series plots will only be generated for bbc.com. We do not currently have access to data from other domains. This is being worked on. However, the virus scan report will change depending on the domain entered so long as it is a valid domain. 
4.  The generated report is saved in your current working directory as a html file
5.  You can double click on the html report to view it.
